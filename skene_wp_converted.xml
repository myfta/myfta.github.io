										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>
  In an age when professional boundaries were more fluid and a restless mind could shape a career across diverse fields, <strong>George Robert Skene</strong> stands out as a compelling example. A man of many vocations, Skene’s life story weaves through medicine, social advocacy, radical politics, agriculture, and newspaper publishing, leaving an imprint in each.
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">From Devon to Southwark: The Early Years</h2>



<p>
  Born in <strong>1802 in Devon</strong>, George Robert Skene was the son of <strong>Andrew and Henrietta Skene</strong>. Like many young men of promise in the early 19th century, George began his professional life in medicine. He trained as a surgeon, most likely at <strong>Mr Grainger’s medical school in Webb Street, Southwark</strong>, a noted centre for anatomical study.
</p>



<p>
  In <strong>1825</strong>, he qualified as a <strong>Member of the Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS)</strong>. During this formative period, Skene moved in circles that mixed medicine with social reform. He encountered influential figures such as <strong>Thomas Wakley</strong> — surgeon, MP, and founder of <em>The Lancet</em> — as well as <strong>Joseph Hume</strong>, radical MP and surgeon, and <strong>Robert Owen</strong>, pioneer of the co-operative movement.
</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Championing the Co-operative Cause</h2>



<p>
  By the late 1820s, Skene was actively involved in promoting co-operative knowledge. He served briefly as <strong>Secretary of the London Association for the Promotion of Co-operative Knowledge</strong>, an organisation closely tied to the <strong>London Mechanics Institute</strong>, where his elder brother, <strong>Philip Orkney Skene</strong>, was treasurer and lecturer until 1830.
</p>



<p>
  In <strong>1829</strong>, this association evolved into the <strong>British Association for Promoting Co-operative Knowledge</strong>, acting as a central hub for the country’s 300 co-operative societies. It distributed pamphlets, organised lectures, and sent “missionaries” to spread the movement’s ideals. Though short-lived (ceasing operations in <strong>1833</strong>), it laid the groundwork for the later <strong>Chartist movement</strong> and the <strong>London Working Men’s Association</strong>.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Country Gentleman: Farming in Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire</h2>



<p>
  After the death of his father, <strong>Andrew Skene, 8th Laird of Halyards</strong>, in <strong>1826</strong>, George moved to <strong>Addersley Lodge near Stoke Goldington, Buckinghamshire</strong>. There, he managed the family’s land and ran a second farm at <strong>Hackleton in Northamptonshire</strong> — properties that had belonged to his grandfather, <strong>Philip Wharton Skene, 7th Laird of Halyards</strong>.
</p>



<p>
  By <strong>1833</strong>, other commitments drew his attention, and he began advertising the farms to let. Four years later, in <strong>1837</strong>, he sold the properties entirely, making way for the next chapter of his career.
</p>

<p><strong>The Bedford Mercury and Radical Journalism</strong>
</p>



<p>
  In a striking career pivot, Skene moved to <strong>Bedford</strong> and founded the <strong>Bedford Mercury and Huntingdon Express</strong> — for many years, the only newspaper printed and published in the town. He operated the business from his premises on <strong>Mill Street</strong>.
</p>



<p>
  By <strong>1840</strong>, Skene had also acquired the <strong>Bucks Gazette</strong>, printed in <strong>Aylesbury</strong>, ensuring his position as a prominent voice for <strong>Liberal politics</strong> in the region. His papers regularly championed progressive causes, from the reform of church rates to the nationalisation of turnpike trusts.
</p>



<p>
  In <strong>1847</strong>, Skene sold the Bedford Mercury to <strong>Rowland Hill</strong> (not to be confused with the inventor of the Penny Post)<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self"><sup>1</sup></a>, before finally leaving Bedford for <strong>Camden, London</strong>, in <strong>1855</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Voice for Reform and the Poor</h2>



<p>Throughout his career, George Skene was never far from a cause. In <strong>1833</strong>, he publicly supported proposals to nationalise turnpike trusts, arguing this would lower maintenance costs and reduce the price of transporting goods and people<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>



<p>That same year, he appeared before the <strong>Petty Sessions</strong> for refusing to pay church rates — a protest against their being levied by an unelected parish vestry and the exemption of glebe lands<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self"><sup>3</sup></a>. His articulate defence led to the case being dropped<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" target="_self"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>



<p>
  In <strong>1834</strong>, he turned his attention to the <strong>New Poor Law</strong>, criticising its implementation for increasing hardship among working families<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5" target="_self"><sup>5</sup></a>. He also took practical action locally, making land available for allotments to support poor families in <strong>Horton</strong>, <strong>Hackleton</strong>, and <strong>Piddington</strong>.
</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>
  G. R. Skene, Esq. of Eakley, has let Nine Acres of Land, in allotments, to the poor of Horton, Hackleton, and Piddington. A small quantity of land has been let on the same principle in Stoke Goldington parish, by Mr. Skene. The parties have been in occupation since September last.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6" href="#footnote-6" target="_self"><sup>6</sup></a>
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Final Years and Legacy</h2>



<p>In <strong>1855</strong>, George left Bedford and settled at <strong>9 Haverstock Hill, Camden</strong>, London. He spent his later years there before moving to <strong>Harrogate, Yorkshire</strong>, where he died on <strong>14 May 1867</strong><a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7" href="#footnote-7" target="_self"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p>



<p>
  A man of restless energy, sharp intellect, and enduring social conscience, <strong>George Robert Skene</strong> left his mark on the fields of medicine, radical politics, rural reform, and journalism. His life is a reminder that meaningful legacies are often built not in a single sphere but through a life of varied, principled endeavour.
